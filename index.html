        <h1>Home Loan Data Explorer</h1>
        <h2>A Look at Home Loan Approval Rates by State</h2>

        <div>
            <p>This app is a tool that allows reporters, housing advocates, and others to quickly visualize trends over time in how lenders treat people who apply for a home loan. Currently, it can visualize data by state and by the race of the applicant. In the future, I'd like to include more categories, like metro area, the type of lender, and the income and gender of the loan applicant.</p>

            <p class="wait">Let's start by taking at a look at home mortgage approval rates by state.
            </p>
            <p class="wait">Please wait a moment while I get the data ready from the Consumer
                Financial Protection Bureau. There's kind of a lot of it, so please be patient.
            </p>

            <div id="loader"></div>

            <p class="ready" style="display:none;">Use the state selector to pick a state
                you want to look at. If you'd like to zoom in to see how home buyers of specific
                racial backgrounds have done in that state, use the race selector as well.
