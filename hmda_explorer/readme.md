# ReadMe file for HMDA Data Grabber

I learned a lot from making this projectâ€”both about coding, about working with
other people's servers, and about home loan data!

That being said, I know it's not perfect. I'm not sure if looping through
hundreds of GET requests is really the best way to handle the fact that the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's servers are too slow to do aggregation in
real time.

I'm excited that it works well at this point, and I'm looking forward to adding
more features and fine-tuning this in the third quarter.

Thanks for helping me do this.
